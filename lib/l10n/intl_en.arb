  "eggEssay": "&emsp;&emsp;Congratulations on discovering the <strong>little easter egg</strong> I hid in CloudOTP! <br/>&emsp;&emsp;I believe that you who found this easter egg are already familiar with CloudOTP, so let me introduce myself first. I am a person who likes to use development to facilitate myself, and I often happily invest time and energy to polish my work. Because I couldn't stand the annoying ads in Lofter, I picked up Flutter to develop CloudOTP again by chance, and adapted it to tablet devices and Windows systems. <br/>&emsp;&emsp;Before CloudOTP, I used native Android to develop a complete small project CloudOTP. This simple two-factor authenticator was favored by my roommate, and even his colleagues asked if there was an IOS version. This was the first time I experienced the wonderful feeling of my work being recognized by others. Maybe in my spare time in the future, I will also use Flutter to reconstruct CloudOTP and present my work to more people who like it. <br/>&emsp;&emsp;I always like to hide Easter eggs in my works, but they are not exciting and unique enough. The inspiration of this Easter egg comes from the Android 14 system. It is the only unsatisfactory one among the Easter eggs I have designed. I dedicate it to you who use CloudOTP. I hope you like this Easter egg and I also hope you like CloudOTP\uD83D\uDC95\uD83D\uDC95. ",
