/// A Material Design app bar.
///
/// An app bar consists of a toolbar and potentially other widgets, such as a
/// [TabBar] and a [FlexibleSpaceBar]. App bars typically expose one or more
/// common [actions] with [IconButton]s which are optionally followed by a
/// [PopupMenuButton] for less common operations (sometimes called the "overflow
/// menu").
///
/// App bars are typically used in the [Scaffold.appBar] property, which places
/// the app bar as a fixed-height widget at the top of the screen. For a scrollable
/// app bar, see [MySliverAppBar], which embeds an [MyAppBar] in a sliver for use in
/// a [CustomScrollView].
///
/// The AppBar displays the toolbar widgets, [leading], [title], and [actions],
/// above the [bottom] (if any). The [bottom] is usually used for a [TabBar]. If
/// a [flexibleSpace] widget is specified then it is stacked behind the toolbar
/// and the bottom widget. The following diagram shows where each of these slots
/// appears in the toolbar when the writing language is left-to-right (e.g.
/// English):
///
/// The [MyAppBar] insets its content based on the ambient [MediaQuery]'s padding,
/// to avoid system UI intrusions. It's taken care of by [Scaffold] when used in
/// the [Scaffold.appBar] property. When animating an [MyAppBar], unexpected
/// [MediaQuery] changes (as is common in [Hero] animations) may cause the content
/// to suddenly jump. Wrap the [MyAppBar] in a [MediaQuery] widget, and adjust its
/// padding such that the animation is scloudotpth.
///
/// ![The leading widget is in the top left, the actions are in the top right,
/// the title is between them. The bottom is, naturally, at the bottom, and the
/// flexibleSpace is behind all of them.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/app_bar.png)
///
/// If the [leading] widget is omitted, but the [MyAppBar] is in a [Scaffold] with
/// a [Drawer], then a button will be inserted to open the drawer. Otherwise, if
/// the nearest [Navigator] has any previous routes, a [BackButton] is inserted
/// instead. This behavior can be turned off by setting the [automaticallyImplyLeading]
/// to false. In that case a null leading widget will result in the middle/title widget
/// stretching to start.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This sample shows an [MyAppBar] with two simple actions. The first action
/// opens a [SnackBar], while the second action navigates to a new page.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/material/app_bar/app_bar.0.dart **

///
/// Material Design 3 introduced new types of app bar.

/// https://m3.material.io/components/top-app-bar/overview
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/material/app_bar/app_bar.1.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ## Troubleshooting
///
/// ### Why don't my TextButton actions appear?
///
/// If the app bar's [actions] contains [TextButton]s, they will not
/// be visible if their foreground (text) color is the same as the
/// app bar's background color.
///
/// In Material v2 (i.e., when [ThemeData.useMaterial3] is false),
/// the default app bar [backgroundColor] is the overall theme's
/// [ColorScheme.primary] if the overall theme's brightness is
/// [Brightness.light]. Unfortunately this is the same as the default
/// [ButtonStyle.foregroundColor] for [TextButton] for light themes.
/// In this case a preferable text button foreground color is
/// [ColorScheme.onPrimary], a color that contrasts nicely with
/// [ColorScheme.primary]. To remedy the problem, override
/// [TextButton.style]:
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This sample shows an [MyAppBar] with two action buttons with their primary
/// color set to [ColorScheme.onPrimary].
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/material/app_bar/app_bar.2.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This example shows how to listen to a nested Scrollable's scroll notification
/// in a nested scroll view using the [notificationPredicate] property and use it
/// to make [scrolledUnderElevation] take effect.

/// A Material Design app bar that integrates with a [CustomScrollView].
///
/// An app bar consists of a toolbar and potentially other widgets, such as a
/// [TabBar] and a [FlexibleSpaceBar]. App bars typically expose one or more
/// common actions with [IconButton]s which are optionally followed by a
/// [PopupMenuButton] for less common operations.
///
/// {@youtube 560 315 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9C5KMJKluE}
///
/// Sliver app bars are typically used as the first child of a
/// [CustomScrollView], which lets the app bar integrate with the scroll view so
/// that it can vary in height according to the scroll offset or float above the
/// other content in the scroll view. For a fixed-height app bar at the top of
/// the screen see [AppBar], which is used in the [Scaffold.appBar] slot.
///
/// The AppBar displays the toolbar widgets, [leading], [title], and
/// [actions], above the [bottom] (if any). If a [flexibleSpace] widget is
/// specified then it is stacked behind the toolbar and the bottom widget.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// This is an example that could be included in a [CustomScrollView]'s
/// [CustomScrollView.slivers] list:
///
/// ```dart
/// SliverAppBar(

///   flexibleSpace: const FlexibleSpaceBar(
